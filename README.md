# dot-emacs
This is a .emacs file derived from Frederick Giason customisation (see http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php/2016/06/14/my-optimal-gnu-emacs-settings-for-developing-clojure-revised).

This .emacs file excludes monokai-theme package and skips font configuration.

Some global key bindings and Windows scroll are currently disabled.
